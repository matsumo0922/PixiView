## Status
#### Ready!! :rocket:

After a long development period, we have finally released on GooglePlay!
However, development is still ongoing, and contributions are always welcome. Please follow the sections below to build the app.

#### [Download](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=caios.android.pixiview) from GooglePlay

## Why?

There was only a web version of FANBOX, which was a bit inconvenient for viewing posts on smartphones. By developing natively for smartphones, we have been able to include several convenient features such as the ability to download posts and receive new notifications.

## Tech Stack

- [Kotlin](https://kotlinlang.org/)
- [Kotlin Coroutines](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/coroutines-overview.html)
- [Kotlin Flow](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/flow.html)
- [Jetpack Compose](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/compose?hl=ja)
- [Jetpack Glance](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/compose/glance)
- [Material3](https://m3.material.io)

## Feature

## Architecture
Shows the architecture diagram of the app. It's quite complex, so I've omitted some modules and dependencies to give you an overview.

  subgraph gradle 
    build-logic  
  end  
  subgraph application

  end  
  subgraph core
    common
    datastore
    model
    repository
    ui
  end
  subgraph feature
    library
    creator

  end

  library --> repository
  post --> ui

  creator --> repository
  ui --> model
  repository --> datastore
  datastore --> model
  model --> common
```

## Contribute

This app uses Gradle's Convention Plugins to standardize the build logic, and all the logic is written in a module called `build-logic`. For information on this approach, see [nowinandroid](https://github.com/matsumo0922/nowinandroid/tree/main/build-logic).

If you find a bug, want to improve a feature, or want to develop a new feature, please first write an issue. Then assign yourself and work on the development. Pull requests are always welcome :smile:

We plan to develop new features using the Pixiv API in the future. When using the API, add Client ID and Client Secret to `local.properties`. By default, it contains an empty string. Read `app/build.gradle.kts` for details.
